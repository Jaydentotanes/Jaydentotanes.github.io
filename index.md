## Favorite Labs 

Lab 1
//
I really liked lab 1 because it was very straightforward, easy to do, and it was a good introduction to what coding looks like. First off the instructions were very straightforward. My partner and i didnt have any issues trying to figure out what the next step was. Second, the lab was easy. I didn't have to look back at my notes or ask for help as much as I did with the other labs. Lastly it was a good introduction, after figuring out how to do the lab after running it opened my eyes to see my finished product. 

Lab 2
//
This was another lab I really enjoyed. Not only was it easy like lab one but this was the first real lab in my opinion that we did. Unlike lab 1 lab 2 dealt with multiple inputs and outputs which made it really fun. Just the COUT and CIN showed how simple coding can be. 

Lab 3

I had fun with this lab because it showed how coding is used in real world applications. I liked this lab because I drive alot and have to deal with parking. So now whenever I go out and look up when I can park I can now imagine what's behind the websites I use to find out when i'm able to park.
